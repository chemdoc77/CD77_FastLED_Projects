For this sketch I use RGBSet arrays from FastLED and I use my chase functions that I orginally described in:

https://forums.adafruit.com/viewtopic.php?f=47&t=128473&p=639866&hilit=chase+chemdoc77#p639866

I control the functions with the TimePerformance code by Mark Kriegsman of FastLED at:

 The Time_Performance tab is where the various functions which are being run at a certain time are located.

 Enjoy,
